# Iter1 Feedback

[TOC]

## Code Quality

- See [implementation.diff](implementation.diff) for a summary of the feedback on your code
- See [tests.diff](tests.diff) for a summary of the feedback on your tests

## Git Practices

- Commit messages were good overall, although avoid messages such as "added 6th", "nothing fixed", "channels update", etc. Try to be specific about the changes you've made.
- Merge requests are mostly approved by a different member, well done
    - Try to be more descriptive with the names
- Issue board discussed during demo, but yes, continue to use deadlines, assign members and create appropriate labels/list :).

## Project Management and Teamwork

- Good evidence of meeting minutes
- Try to include more standups, e.g. take a screenshot with everyone messaging what they've done on a particular day.
