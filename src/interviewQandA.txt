Interview 1 : 
            name: Dominic Chan

            1. Treats is generally satisfactory as it mimics many of the primary features other big communication
               software achieves (such as skype, discord, microsoft teams)
            2. Key features from other communication applications that could be implemented are the addition of many 
               types of reacts to messages rather than just a 'like/ thumbs up' in treats
            3. Benefits of this include greater expression of ones reaction to a particular message, which could
               mean reduced time thinking of what to respond, since you can just react with your exact emotion at the time

            1. Treats feels quite underdeveloped in comparision to other communication applications, however i understand
               that Treats is a new work in progress application and so cant expect it to be up to the same standards as 
               other communication giants
            2. A good feature could be predictive text, like on apple Iphone keyboards. It could suggest a list of
               predetermined responses after analysing key words given to the program
            3. Benefits could range from increased work productivity to coworkers, when asked simple question that can 
               be broadly answered. For example 
                                                person1: "have you left home to come to work yet"
                                                person2: "On my way now!"
