# Iter2 Feedback

[TOC]

## Code Quality

- See [implementation.diff](implementation.diff) for a summary of the feedback on your code
- See [tests.diff](tests.diff) for a summary of the feedback on your tests

## Git Practices

- Commit messages are good for the most part, well done. Some can still be a little more specific though, e.g. "modified tests"
- Most merge requests have descriptive messages, a member assigned and a different member approved, well done.
- Issues were created, assigned and with a due date on the issue board
    - However, most issues aren't completed, and some are not a reflection of the progress in your repository.
    - Make sure to keep your issue board updated :).
    - Also, avoid setting the deadline to be the same for all of them - you want to complete and merge small, working code into the master branch regularly.

## Project Management and Teamwork

- Evidence of standups included - try to add more screenshots for different days though.
    - You want to do this often, and also try to help everyone stay on task.
- Meeting minutes are present, although try to conduct more meetings and include further information about what you've discussed in addition to work division.
